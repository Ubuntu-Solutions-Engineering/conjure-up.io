At the heart of **conjure-up** are spells. They consist of all the information
required to deploy your applications and walk the user through getting started
as quickly as possible.

There are 2 main parts that make up a spell. The first being a **Juju bundle**,
these are your blueprints for defining the amount of units for each application
along with any default configuration options you wish to expose to the user for
modification.

The second part is the additional data added to the spell to be **conjure-up**
enabled. This contains your metadata which describes the spell and a set of
steps that you define for a user to walkthrough. This allows you as a spell
author to ensure that a user can learn about your application and at the end
know exactly what to do next in order to make the most out of your application.

It is recommended to learn the <<spell-anatomy>>
in order to get started building your spell!

[[spell-anatomy]]
== Anatomy of a conjure-up spell

We will start with the directory layout of a typical spell. Some of this will be
familiar as we build on the existing Juju bundle specification.

[[spell-metadata]]
=== Spell Metadata

The spell metadata contains properties that are useful for conjure-up to process
certain aspects of a spell. Available properties are as follows:

friendly-name:: This is used during the spell selection within conjure-up.
cloud-whitelist:: A list of Public clouds available for a spell.
cloud-blacklist:: A list of Public clouds that are known to not work with a spell.
options-whitelist:: Additional charm options to be exposed for editing within conjure-up.
bundle-location:: A URL of the location of a bundle.yaml, ie https://api.jujucharms.com/charmstore/v5/wiki-scalable/archive/bundle.yaml

[[spell-steps]]
=== Steps

During a deployment, **conjure-up** will always check for and run a predefined set of scripts:

00_pre-deploy:: This script contains necessary instructions for configuring a system prior to a deployment (<<pre-deploy>>).
00_deploy-done:: This script will contain instructions for verifying that deployment has finished and is ready for its next steps (<<deploy-done>>).
step-##_a_step:: This is an alpha numerical script that will be executed in order to perform any actions necessary to provide a turn key and usuable deployment.

[[pre-deploy]]
==== 00_pre-deploy

In some cases, like OpenStack with NovaLXD modifications need to be made to the
LXD container profile to allow for certain kernel modules and networking to be
enabled. This needs to happen prior to any applications being deployed in the container.

.An example of 00_pre-deploy for OpenStack with NovaLXD
[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/bash

set -eu

# Path to executing script
SCRIPT=$(readlink -e $0)

# Directory housing script
SCRIPTPATH=$(dirname $SCRIPT)

. $CONJURE_UP_SPELLSDIR/sdk/common.sh <1>

if [[ "$JUJU_PROVIDERTYPE" == "lxd" ]]; then <2> <3>
    debug "Running pre-deploy for $CONJURE_UP_SPELL"
    sed "s/##MODEL##/$JUJU_MODEL/" $SCRIPTPATH/lxd-profile.yaml | lxc profile edit "juju-$JUJU_MODEL" || exposeResult "Failed to set profile" $? "false" <4>
fi

exposeResult "Successful pre-deploy." 0 "true" <5>
----
<1> **CONJURE_UP_SPELLSDIR** environment variable is already exposed and is useful if wanting to use the provided spell sdk.
<2> Is exposed as an environment variable to check the type of public cloud this script is running in.
<3> Since we are doing this on a container it makes sense to only work with the **LXD** type.
<4> This performs an inplace update of the LXD profile. Due to the nature of LXD this profile will be available immediately even on containers that have already started.
<5> Helper function part of the builtin hooklib for writing steps. This lets conjure-up know that this pre-deploy task has completed without error.

[[deploy-done]]
==== 00_deploy-done

Before we can process any additional steps we need to wait for all the deployed applications to become in a **ready** state. Below demonstrates a couple of ways to check for an error of the unit or machine:

.An example of 00_deploy-done for OpenStack with NovaLXD
[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/bash
set -eu

# Path to executing script
SCRIPT=$(readlink -e $0)

# Directory housing script
SCRIPTPATH=$(dirname $SCRIPT)

. $CONJURE_UP_SPELLSDIR/sdk/common.sh

juju wait -m $JUJU_CONTROLLER:$JUJU_MODEL <1>

exposeResult "Applications Ready" 0 "true" <2>
----
<1> **juju wait** is included with conjure-up and allows us to easily determine when all applications are in a ready state.
<2> All scripts must end with JSON output describing the result, in this case the Applications are in a ready state.


[[post-processing-steps]]
==== Post processing

There are 2 sections to post processing. The first section is the **step
metadata**, this metadata provides conjure-up some context about what to display
to the user for configuration and how to pass that information to the processing
script.

Steps are created alpha numerically and have 2 files associated. The first file
being the step script named **step-01_keypair**. The second file is the metadata
for that step named **step-01_keypair.yaml**.

The metadata for a step consists of:

title:: A short title of the step
description:: A summary of what this steps does
viewable:: Boolean to indicate if this steps summary and actions are seen within conjure-up
required:: Boolean to indicate that this step is a requirement and has to be run
additional-input:: Additional configuration variables that can be changed by the user within conjure-up <<additional-input>>

===== Additional Input

This section of the step describes the configuration object and how it is to be
displayed to the user within conjure-up and how a step would utilize the result
from the user input.

The additional input has the following properties:

label:: Rendered label describing the input
key:: The result of input is stored in this key which is exposed via environment variables
type:: Type of input
default:: Default value for input

----
<1> This is the environment variable that was defined in the **key** section of **step-01_keypair.yaml**
<2> **JUJU_CONTROLLER** and **JUJU_MODEL** are exposed through environments variables for all steps. These can be relied on to make sure you are always operating in the most current juju environment.
