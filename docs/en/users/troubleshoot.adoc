=== Running conjure-up remotely

If you ssh into a seperate machine to run **conjure-up** and you deploy spells
such as openstack-novalxd to localhost and you want to be able to
access things like the `openstack dashboard`.

The simplest way to accomplish this is on your local machine run the following:

[source.bash]
----
$ sudo apt install sshuttle
$ sshuttle -r <remote-host-ip> <subnet-of-localhost-deployment>
----

The subnet of localhost is going to be what **conjure-up** configured the
network bridge for. By default this is set to **10.0.8.1/24**. Lets also say the
remote host's ip is **172.16.0.5** so you'll want to do the following

[source.bash]
----
$ sshuttle -r 17.16.0.5 10.0.8.1/24
[local sudo] Password:
client: Connected.
----

It will then ask you to enter your sudo password and once complete will let you
know that the sshuttle is connected. From there you can open your web browser
and access the horizon dashboard as if it was running on your local machine.

Assuming the **openstack-dashboard** was deployed to a machine whose ip is
**10.0.8.15**, you could run:

[source,bash]
----
$ xdg-open https://10.0.8.15/horizon
----

=== Logging

**conjure-up** logs are written to **journald** by default. Viewing those logs can be done with:

[source,bash]
----
$ journalctl |grep conjure-up
----

NOTE: There is also a log file that is written to **$HOME/.cache/conjure-up/conjure-up.log**

=== Unicode

If the system running **conjure-up** does not have its locale defined to **UTF-8** a failure will occur similar to:

[source,python]
----
UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xe2 in position 2201: ordinal not in range(128)
----

To fix you will need to set your locale accordingly, for example:

[source,bash]
----
$ locale
LANG=en_US.UTF-8
LANGUAGE=en_US
LC_CTYPE="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_NUMERIC="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_TIME="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_COLLATE="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_MONETARY="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_MESSAGES="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_PAPER="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_NAME="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_ADDRESS="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_TELEPHONE="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_MEASUREMENT="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_IDENTIFICATION="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_ALL=

== Common Spell Problems

=== LXD

==== Failed deployments if IPv6 is enabled

Currently conjure-up does not support the use of IPv6. If you are running LXD
and have a bridge that has IPv6 enabled conjure-up will fail and give you an
explanation as to why and information for disabling IPv6.

===== Disable IPv6 on LXD versions 2.2 and below

LXD version 2.0 is the default version on Ubuntu Xenial 16.04. To disable IPv6
you'll need to edit **/etc/default/lxd-bridge** and make sure the following
values are reflected below:

[source,ini]
----
# IPv6
## IPv6 address (e.g. 2001:470:b368:4242::1)
LXD_IPV6_ADDR=""

## IPv6 CIDR mask (e.g. 64)
LXD_IPV6_MASK=""

## IPv6 network (e.g. 2001:470:b368:4242::/64)
LXD_IPV6_NETWORK=""

## NAT IPv6 traffic
LXD_IPV6_NAT="false"
----

===== Disable IPv6 on LXD versions 2.4 and above

To disable IPv6 on your LXD bridge (**lxdbr0** by default) run the following:

[source,bash]
----
lxc network set lxdbr0 ipv6.nat false
lxc network set lxdbr0 ipv6.address none
----

=== OpenStack Base for MAAS

==== config-changed error for neutron-gateway

This error can happen if you've not set your **bridge-mappings** and
**data-port** during the <<application-list>> portion of the deployment.

Please see https://jujucharms.com/neutron-gateway/[the Neutron Gateway charm
documentation] under **Port Configuration** for more information.
