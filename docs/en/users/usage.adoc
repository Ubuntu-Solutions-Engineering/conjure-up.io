[[usage]]
== Advanced Spell Summoning

*conjure-up* includes several spells in addition to supporting summoning
spells from several remote repositories and from a local directory on
your filesystem.

[[githubbitbucket]]
=== GitHub/BitBucket

Not quite ready to push your spell to the charm registry? That's ok,
simply push your spell to GitHub and conjure-up can deploy from there:

....
$ conjure-up battlemidget/ghost
....

This would pull from GitHub repo https://github.com/battlemidget/ghost

[[remote-web-server]]
=== Remote Web Server

*conjure-up* will also support downloading directly from a webserver.
For example, if you have your spell zipped up and stored at
http://example.com/my-conjure-spell.zip you could install it like so:

....
$ conjure-up http://example.com/my-conjure-spell.zip
....

[[local-filesystem]]
=== Local Filesystem

Passing in either the directory path of the spell or if the current
working directory is a spell:

....
$ conjure-up ~/spells/openstack/openstack-novalxd
....

Or from *cwd*

....
$ ~/spells/openstack/openstack-novalxd> conjure-up .
....

[[running-in-headless-mode]]
=== Running in Headless Mode

*conjure-up* is meant to be a teaching tool in addition to a full blown
application deployment tool. By Default *conjure-up* will walk you
through the entire deployment process and help you understand what it is
you are deploying.

Where this doesn't make sense is if you are wanting to deploy your
application in an automated fashion. For example, integrating the
deployment with a Jenkins CI server.

For these cases *conjure-up* provides a headless mode.

To deploy in a headless mode you'll need to have credentials defined if
deploying to a Public Cloud or make sure LXD is configured if deploying
to Localhost.

To deploy OpenStack to a Localhost provider:

....
$ conjure-up openstack-novalxd localhost
....

If we want to deploy to a cloud like AWS:

....
$ conjure-up canonical-kubernetes aws
....

NOTE: Keep in mind you'll need to have credentials defined, see
https://jujucharms.com/docs/stable/credentials[Juju credentials] for more
details.

[[customize-headless-mode]]
==== Customizing headless mode

Post deployment actions are exposed to the environment via environment
variables. Some actions may require you to input data depending on what is
required. An example would be input the path of your public ssh key so that your
OpenStack deployment can make those available to the compute nodes.

To see what environment variables you can set prior to running a headless mode install, run the following:

[source,bash]
----
$ conjure-up --show-env openstack-novalxd localhost
Available environment variables:

+--------------+-------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| ENV          | DEFAULT           |                                                         |
+--------------+-------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| SSHPUBLICKEY | ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | Import SSH keypairs into OpenStack. This allows you to  |
|              |                   | access the newly deployed instances via SSH with your   |
|              |                   | current user. If you are not sure about the location of |
|              |                   | a ssh key leave it as is and we will create one         |
|              |                   | automatically.                                          |
+--------------+-------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+

See http://conjure-up.io/docs/en/users/#running-in-headless-mode for more
information on using these variables to further customize your deployment.
----

In order to change it from it's default of **~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub** you would simply do:

[source,bash]
----
$ SSHPUBLICKEY=/home/bob/my-ssh-key.pub conjure-up openstack-novalxd localhost
