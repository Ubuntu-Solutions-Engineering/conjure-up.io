      p.lead Conjure-up is a power tool for getting started with big software.
      p Conjure-up lets you summon up a big-software stack as a “spell” - a model of the stack, combined with extra know-how to get you from an installed stack to a fully usable one. Start using your big software instead of learning how to deploy it.
